# Ai-Driven-Climate-Risk-Assessment-for-Energy-Infrastructure

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting wind turbine damage and wind patterns using machine learning. It consists of four main modules, each dedicated to a specific area of research and development.

## Modules

### Module 1: Exposure Model
- **Objective**: Develop an object detection model to identify wind turbines from satellite data.
- **Features**:
  - Utilizes Faster RCNN, an advanced object detection model.
  - Capable of recognizing wind turbines under various environmental conditions.

### Module 2: Vulnerability Model
- **Objective**: Evaluate the vulnerability of wind turbines to environmental stressors.
- **Features**:
  - In-depth case study analysis, documented in a comprehensive report (>30 pages).
  - Analysis of 12 real-world damage cases.
  - Logistic Regression model for predicting damage probability (0% to 100%).
  - 
### Module 3: Weather Forecasting Model
- **Objective**: Forecast wind patterns affecting wind turbines.
- **Features**:
  - Implements a pre-trained CNN model specialized in wind prediction.
  - Focuses on two critical components of wind.

### Module 4: Data Release
- **Objective**: Share the developed models and data with the public and research community.
- **Features**:
  - All models and data are open-source on GitHub.
  - An API for easier model integration and application.
